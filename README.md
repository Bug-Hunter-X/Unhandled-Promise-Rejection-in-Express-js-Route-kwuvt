# Unhandled Promise Rejection in Express.js Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: neglecting proper error handling within asynchronous route handlers.  When an asynchronous operation within a route fails, the error is logged to the console but the client receives no indication of the failure. This leads to a poor user experience and makes debugging more challenging.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file shows an Express.js route that performs an asynchronous operation.  If the asynchronous operation rejects (fails), the error is caught and logged, but the client receives no response.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the correct approach.  If the asynchronous operation fails, an appropriate error response (e.g., a 500 Internal Server Error) is sent to the client, providing feedback and preventing silent failures.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run `node bug.js` to start the server with the buggy code.
4. Make multiple requests to `http://localhost:3000/`. You'll see some requests succeed, and some will fail silently.
5. Run `node bugSolution.js` to start the server with the corrected code.
6. Make multiple requests to `http://localhost:3000/`. Now, failed requests will return a proper error response.
